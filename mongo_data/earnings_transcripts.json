Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and the rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro, and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SOS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game. A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in-one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult comparison with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home, and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult comparison with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double-tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 makes it easier to answer calls, play and pause music, or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continues to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services, and video, as well as December quarter records in the App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies, and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher. Turning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do key work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by a core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.","sentiment":"0.7"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"680885047329ce07337b2297"},"quarter":"2024Q1","symbol":"AAPL","call_date":"2025-04-21T13:53:25.866838","timestamp":"2025-04-21","speaker":"Luca Maestri","title":"CFO","content":"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and the rest of Asia-Pacific and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging comparisons for iPad and Wearables, Home, and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and returned to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is at an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch comparison and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Macs, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000-plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.","sentiment":"0.5"}

Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. And congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you. Can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us?

But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter?

Let's begin with the December quarter. As mentioned, we saw an 11% increase, reaching $23.1 billion, which is a record for us, with significant achievements in The Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. This growth was widespread across all geographic regions and robust across all Services categories, as we set revenue records in cloud, payments, video, advertising, as well as records for the App Store and AppleCare in the December quarter. It’s important to note that last year included an extra week, making our underlying performance stronger than the reported 11%. The entire ecosystem is thriving, as reflected in the growth of both transacting accounts and paid accounts, both of which are critical metrics. Our paid subscriptions are continuing to grow at a strong double-digit rate, and we have surpassed one billion paid subscriptions across all service platforms, more than double what we had just four years ago, marking significant growth. Regarding the March quarter, I indicated during my prepared remarks that we expect to maintain a similar double-digit growth rate as we did for the December quarter.

Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets have been a very key area of strength for us.

And we had several regions, with records from Latin America to the Middle East. That theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters of the year as well.

We performed particularly well in emerging markets, including Latin America and the Middle East, and set records for the December quarter in India and Indonesia. There has been a fantastic response to the iPhone, with an all-time high for iPhone upgraders and the installed base reaching a new record. Additionally, iPhones accounted for four of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan, four of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all five in Australia.

And so, we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product and it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so, we're incredibly excited about it.

Last week, we announced several changes in Europe set to take effect in March, which is the last month of the first calendar quarter and the second fiscal quarter. Among the changes are alternate billing options, different app stores, and our marketplaces. We are also enabling NFC for new banking and wallet app capabilities. These are some of the measures we've introduced. Over the years, we have focused on privacy, security, and usability. We have made every effort to retain the features that users love about our ecosystem, but we will inevitably be limited in what we can offer due to regulatory compliance.

Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well as you would imagine. I guess, the first question I wanted to just ask maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margin specifically. So, I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, where there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component, obligations that you've put in place, let's say, a year ago, and that flowing through.

On the product side and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company. On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So, obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course, it's the biggest quarter of the year for us, so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange. But net-net, obviously, very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so, the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.","sentiment":"0.4"}

And then, the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that your capital expenditures have actually come down this last year. I'm curious as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for generative AI, kind of platform as we move forward?

Additionally, you mentioned strong gross margins. While I understand some commodity costs were deflationary last year, it appears they are becoming inflationary now.

The first part of the question was about the $5 billion. A year ago, we encountered supply disruptions for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max due to factory shutdowns caused by COVID-19. Consequently, there was pent-up demand that was fulfilled as we moved out of the December quarter, and we also addressed channel fill during the March quarter. The nearly $5 billion I mentioned is entirely related to the iPhone. Regarding gross margins, we are currently at very high levels and I've reiterated that we have experienced good expansion over the past few quarters. We are now projecting gross margins of 46% to 47%, which considers the commodity environment, foreign exchange conditions, and our product and services mix. The result of this is strong guidance, which we are pleased with.","sentiment":"0.4"}

And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer-centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Mac, it's sort of penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future?

That if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so, it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of Enterprise in a long time. And so, I think there's a potential fit for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of the iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.","sentiment":"0.6"}

What do you believe needs to change to potentially re-accelerate business in the Americas, especially in the iPhone segment? Also, I want to clarify the guidance. Considering the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I account for it this quarter or back it out from the last, the March quarter appears to be the softest since the COVID pandemic.

It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last 6 years, we have gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion. This shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses. Now let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are 6 points to make: one, research leadership; two, infrastructure leadership; three, innovation in Search; four, our global product footprint; five, velocity in execution; six, monetization paths. First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text, code and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of applications. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100x more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. AI innovations in Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we've been experimenting with SGE in search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where generative AI can improve the search experience while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants. We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video and get an AI overview with Lens. Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have 6 products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. 15 products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100-plus countries. This gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful generative AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. Fifth, improved velocity in execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model-building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader. And last week, we took another step, bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement. We continue to manage our head count growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in Labs, driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud as well as subscriptions. Philipp will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. Google One has now crossed 100 million paid subscribers, and in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the 6 points so now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past 8 months. At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart and many more. Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and nearly 90% of generative AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available, and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google design and Arm-based CPU. In benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems. On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open-source models, and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. And we shared that more than 1 million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying generative AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their generative AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications. In Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University, and PennyMac are using Gemini and Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for Meetings and Messaging and Gemini Security for Workspace. Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence, and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days. Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including trial subscribers. YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix with high customer satisfaction, and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin. Overall, it was a great quarter, and there's more to come. IO is in less than 3 weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services, and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you.","sentiment":"0.9"}

Google Services revenue of $70 billion was up 14% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year led again by solid growth in the retail vertical with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023. YouTube Ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective. First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our Ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types. We've talked about whole solutions like Smart Bidding using AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand and how products like broad match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors generative AI is opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the promise of getting the right ad to the right user at the right moment. Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into Performance Max. It's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet Performance Max asset requirements instantly. This is available to all U.S. advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English, and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using Performance Max asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. And those who improve their Performance Max ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with generative AI. Those adopting automatically created assets see, on average, 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns. And then there's Dimension. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touchpoints like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail, and Discover. Hollywood film and TV studio, Lionsgate, partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type will deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes film. Over a 3-week test, demand generation was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out demand generation for 2 new titles. We're also bringing new creative features to demand generation. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for elevating visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. And then there's obviously the Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about. I laid out that innovation and the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including Ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again the top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and offline as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences. Highlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile-budged and bidding strategies across Search, Performance Max, or both; take-home goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and offline sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options, and more all in one ad format. Moving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-over-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million-plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that the YouTube Partner Program has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last 3 years. From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12-plus months. In the first quarter, Living Room. benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, from their favorite creators to live sports, breaking news, educational content, movies, music, and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth. On the Ads front, both direct and brand were strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, Living Room, and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that pause ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers. Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across cloud and ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply generative AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system, already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including The Coca-Cola Company, L'Oreal and Nestle. We're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock. With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter.","sentiment":"0.7"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"680885047329ce07337b22d6"},"quarter":"2024Q1","symbol":"GOOG","call_date":"2025-04-21T13:53:26.671433","timestamp":"2025-04-21","speaker":"Ruth Porat","title":"CFO","content":"Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter driven, in particular, by strength in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15% or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content. On an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues was up 13% year-on-year. Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting, first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expenses primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in sales and marketing, a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expenses primarily for Cloud sales. Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%. Net income was $23.7 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TVAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google Services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%. And the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within Advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth driven by brand and direct response. Looking ahead, two points to call out: first, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter; second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only 1 week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers. With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet: first, Q1 results reflect the benefit of the leap year, which contributed slightly more than 1 point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter; second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1. Turning to margins. Our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind, and technical infrastructure. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today. Given the extraordinary opportunities ahead, we view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program.","sentiment":"0.6"}

And they're very much the same that we've talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure. These are ongoing. And so as an example, the work that Sundar talked about, combining devices and services with our platforms and ecosystems, product area is a really good example because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher-quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency. And then the other work streams we've talked to you about in the past, like all of the work around technical infrastructure, which Sundar alluded to; streamlining operations within the company through the use of AI; what we're doing with procurement with our suppliers and vendors, which he also referenced; the work you've seen on real estate optimization, these are all ongoing work streams, which is why we have them under the umbrella, durably reengineering our cost base, and they are ongoing.","sentiment":"0.5"}

Can you just talk about what kind of queries or scenarios do you think that that's working best for so far? And just how we should think about the cadence of continuing to adopt more of those features within core search. And then Ruth, on CapEx spending, the $12 billion in Q1, can we assume that run rating that and above is reasonable for this year?

On SGE in Search, we are seeing early confirmation of our thesis that this will expand the universe of queries where we are able to really provide people with a mix of actual answers linked to sources across the Web and bring a variety of perspectives, all in an innovative way. And we've been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and the U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries which are more complex, where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience. We've already served billions of queries, and it seems to cut across categories, but we are still continuing our testing. And we are metrics-driven in these areas. But I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience. Users are telling us that. And we are seeing it in our metrics, and we'll continue evolving it through the course of this year.","sentiment":"0.8"}

As I said, you can always have variability in the reported quarterly CapEx just due to the timing of cash payments, but roughly at or above this level. And it really goes to Sundar's opening comment that we're very committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure to support the growth in Cloud, all the innovation in Search that he and Philipp have spoken about and our lead with Gemini. I will note that nearly all of the CapEx was in our technical infrastructure. We expect that our investment in office facilities will be about less than 10% of the total CapEx in 2024, roughly flat with our CapEx in 2023, but is still there. And then with respect to 2025, as you said, it's premature to comment so nothing to add on that.","sentiment":"0.5"}

Sundar, if we come back to your earlier comments at the beginning of the call and framing up longer-term initiatives and longer-term narratives, I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about both the opportunities and the challenges of operating at scale in a time like this where there's a lot of technology innovation going on and how you see the elements of trying to strike a balance towards moving the organization forward while still continuing to both invest for growth as well as balance margins.","sentiment":"0.0"}

Great question. Obviously, I think the AI transition, I think it's a once-in-a-generation opportunity. We've definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine we started building TPUs in 2016, so we've definitely been gearing up for a long time. The real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation that we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way, and it impacts the entire breadth of the company, whether it be Search, YouTube, Cloud, or Waymo and so on. We see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. So it's a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead. In terms of the challenges, I think it's been a mindset shift, which we've been driving across the company to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity but being very efficient in how we are approaching it, making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company, building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year-on-year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible. So making sure balancing all of that moving forward in a very bold and responsible way at the same time. Those are the important things to get right from my perspective.","sentiment":"0.6"}

And you've given us an update on monetization pickup sequentially. But with that in mind, I think YouTube has launched an array of ad products and automation tools to help advertisers transfer what they're doing to the vertical screen. So how is this translating into buy-in among your advertiser clients? And secondly, based on what you've seen over the last 2 years, are there any structural reasons that you can cite as to why the monetization cannot match what is already the case on the horizontal screen?","sentiment":"0.0"}

Look, this is a great question, first of all. I mean, let's start with the fact that YouTube performance was very strong in this quarter. And on Shorts specifically in the U.S., I mentioned how the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months. I think that's what you were referring to. And yes, we're obviously very happy with this development. The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. So you can assume that this wouldn't be happening unless it worked for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That's an important part, I think. Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video. We talked about the strong growth, averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels uploading has increased 50% year-over-year, so again, very happy with this development. And to your question, structural reasons as to why we can't get to a match here, I have a hard time seeing those at the moment over time.","sentiment":"0.7"}

It seems to be your biggest investment area. Just first, you saw the big uptick the last 2 quarters, but you've been investing in AI for years. Is the uptick because supply is getting easier to get? Or do you see more opportunities with the available supply to really fuel AI? So has the GPUs and everything gotten better that you feel more, investing more? And then thinking about the returns, both for Advertising and Cloud on the CapEx, do you feel like this is a higher cost of doing business? Or do you think this is an opportunity to even get better returns on your capital spend than you've had in the past?","sentiment":"0.0"}

It starts with all that we're doing in support of the Gemini foundational model but then also, clearly, the work across Cloud, on behalf of Cloud customers, and the growth that we're seeing with GCP and the infrastructure work there, and then, of course, as both Sundar and Philipp talked about the application across Search, YouTube and, more broadly, the services that we're able to offer. So it's the growing application and our focus on ensuring that we have the compute capacity to deliver in support of the services and opportunities we see across Alphabet. And it really goes to the second part of your question, which is that as we're investing in CapEx and applying it across our various businesses, it opens up more services and products, which bring revenue opportunities. And we're very focused on the monetization opportunity. It does underlie everything that we're doing in Google Services and Google Cloud.","sentiment":"0.5"}

First on GCP, you had nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities and constraints upon GCP's ability to continue to address that large addressable market and accelerate growth? Is it more sales-oriented? Is it more product sales solutions or both? And do you plan to address most of these organically? Or could a partner approach work for you? And the second one, just more detail on YouTube and sports rights. Could you reiterate your view on further live sports rights? There's some larger, mostly in the U.S., league rights coming up soon and will be more over the next several years.

I think the AI transformation is making everyone think about their whole stack, and we are engaged in a number of conversations. I think paid AI infrastructure, people are really looking to Vertex AI, given our depth and breadth of model choice, or using Workspace to transform productivity in your workplace, et cetera. So I think the opportunities there are all related to that, both all the work we've built up and AI being a point of inflection in terms of driving conversations. I think you'll see us do it both organically and with a strong partner program as well. So we'll do it with a combination. And the challenges here, always, there are switching costs to Cloud and the challenges we see is how do we make it easier for people. There's a lot of interest, but there are definitely barriers in terms of people switching. And so that's an area where we are constantly investing to make it easier for our customers.","sentiment":"0.6"}

So you guys are powering all these new AI interactions and searches on Pixel and on Samsung devices. And I think there's speculation that Gemini might be used on iOS in a future state. So the question is, as users start searching on smartphones and those searches are basically rendered on the model, on the phone, without accessing the web, how do you guys anticipate monetizing some of these smartphone-based behaviors that are kind of run on the edge?

So I think there will be a set of use cases which you will be able to do on-device. But for a lot of what people are looking to do, I think you will need the richness of the cloud, the Web and you have to deliver it to users. So again, to my earlier comments, I think through all these moments, you saw what we have done with Samsung with Circle to Search. I think it gives a new way for people to access Search conveniently wherever they are. And so we view this as a positive way to bring our services to users in a more seamless manner. So I think it's positive from that perspective. In terms of on-device versus cloud, there will be needs that can be done on-device and we should help it from a privacy standpoint. But there are many things for which people will need to reach out to the cloud. And so I don't see that as being a big driver in the on-cloud versus off-cloud in any way.","sentiment":"0.6"}

And we've been in live experiments just for a few weeks in the U.S. and U.K. on a slice of our queries, and all indications are positive that it improves user satisfaction. We see an increase in engagement, but I see this as something which will play out over time. But if you were to step back at this moment, there were a lot of questions last year, and we always felt confident and comfortable that we would be able to improve the user experience. People question whether these things would be costly to serve, and we are very, very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries. People worried about latency. When I look at the progress we have made in latency and efficiency, we feel comfortable. There are questions about monetization. And based on our testing so far, I'm comfortable and confident that we'll be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well. It will play out over time, but I feel we are well positioned.

We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, driven by the continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24%. With Copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack, and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure again took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 data center regions worldwide, as well as the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. We also have our AI services deployed in more regions than any other cloud provider. This quarter, we announced the general availability of our next-generation H100 Virtual Machines. Azure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting specific cost latency and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation, more than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI services, including new Azure customers. We continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We're meeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers, up 140% year-over-year. We are the only cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle databases to our cloud. Customers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using Oracle database instances on Azure. And we are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads too. Companies like Brother Industries, Hanes, ZEISS, and ZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data, in the age of Copilots, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estate; that's why with our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we are bringing together operational data stores, analytics, and governance. More than 73% of the Fortune 1000 use three or more of our data solutions today. And with Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytical solution with an all-inclusive business model. More than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we are increasing developer productivity by up to 55%, while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot users and more than 37,000 organizations have subscribed to Copilot for business, up 40% quarter-over-quarter with significant traction outside the United States. This quarter we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as leading enterprises like Maersk and PwC to supercharge the productivity of their software developers. Overall, the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x since our acquisition five years ago. We've also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota have all used Copilot in Power Platform to date. EY, for example, has enabled Copilot for all 170,000-plus Power Platform users at the company. And this quarter we added new Copilot capabilities to Power Pages, making it possible to build a data-driven website using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader in low-code no-code development, now with 20 million monthly active users, up 40% year-over-year. Now on to business applications, overall Dynamics 365 took share for the 10th consecutive quarter. We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our Sales Copilot helps sellers at more than 15,000 organizations, including Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance, personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. We're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas to faster access to valuable business data. This quarter, we introduced Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, our Dragon Ambient Experience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 million interactions to date. And with DAX Copilot, we are applying generative AI models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. For example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in the Southeast United States, credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians save up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We are also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern Medicine and SingHealth to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for sovereignty, which will become generally available by the end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the world. Now on to the future of work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook, and more collaborative in Teams. Tens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic, Suncorp, and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it, and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week. This quarter, we also introduced a new hero experience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using chat. The new Copilot Lab helps employees build new work habits for this era of AI by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than 320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling. This quarter, we introduced a new version of Teams that is up to 2 times faster, while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration. We've seen nine consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become a multiplayer canvas for business processes. There are more than 2,000 apps in the Teams Store, and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian, and Workday each exceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams. With Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience, helping companies like Dell, Lloyds Banking Group, and PayPal build high-performance organizations. With skills in Viva, we are bringing together information from Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn to help employers understand workforce gaps and suggest personalized learning content to address it, all in the flow of work. Overall, we continue to see more organizations choose Microsoft 365, and companies across the private and public sectors, including Cerberus, Chanel, and DXC Technology, all rely on our Premium E5 offerings for advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. The PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic levels, and we continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to Windows 11 ever, adding 150 new features including new AI-powered experiences in apps like Clipchamp, Paint, and Photos, and we introduced Copilot in Windows, the Everyday AI companion, which incorporates the context to the web, your work data, and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance. We are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Kantar, and RBC. Finally, with Windows 365 Boot and Switch, we're making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, and ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365 Cloud PC with Copilot on any device. Now on to security. The speed, scale, and sophistication of cyberattacks today is unparalleled, and security is the number one priority for CIOs worldwide. We see high demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta have been using Copilot in Preview, and early feedback has been positive. We look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of the new early access program so they can improve the productivity of their own security operation centers and stop threats at machine speeds. More broadly, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve, and our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, now has more than 25,000 customers in revenue, surpassing a $1 billion annual run-rate. Customers in every industry, like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thornton, and MetLife use our end-to-end solutions to protect their environments. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell, and get hired. Membership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row. This quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our businesses, including our learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines, and tools to help employers find qualified candidates and sellers and marketers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, three-fourths of them say it saved them time. We have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter. More broadly, we continue to see record engagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year-over-year. Premium subscription sign-ups were up 55% year-over-year, and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With our Copilot for the Web, we are redefining how people use the Internet to search and create. Bing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and Microsoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers, as well as support for DALL-E 3, helping people get more relevant answers and create incredibly realistic images with more than 1.8 billion images created to date. With our Copilot and Shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new endpoints, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat experience in order to provide more up-to-date answers, as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI directly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketers to customer intent in chat experiences, both from us as well as customers like Axel Springer and Snap. Now on to gaming. We were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of bringing great games to players everywhere on any endpoint. Already with Game Pass, we're redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We set a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter. We released Starfield this quarter to broader acclaim, with more than 11 million people having played the game to date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC, and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever. Minecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold, and with Activision Blizzard King, we now add significant depth to our content portfolio. We will have $13 billion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, Halo, Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. We're looking forward to one of our strongest first-party holiday lineups ever, including new titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses as we help our customers thrive in this new era. In just a few weeks, we'll be holding our flagship Ignite Conference, where we will introduce more than 100 new products and capabilities, including exciting new AI innovations. I encourage you to tune in.","sentiment":"0.9"}

This quarter's revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99, an increase of 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year. Results exceeded expectations, and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In our commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5, and the growth of new business continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected, the optimization trends were similar to Q4. Higher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. In our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend landed roughly in line with our expectations, and in gaming, strong engagement, helped by the Starfield launch, benefited Xbox content and services. Commercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, with continued growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 18% to $212 billion, and roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 20% and this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion, growing 24% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvements in Azure. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the mentioned improvement in Azure as well as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, the gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as well as a sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 1%, lower than expected due to cost-efficiency focus as well as investments that shifted to future quarters. Operating expense growth was driven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 48%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points, driven by improved operating leverage through cost management and the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results in Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 15% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with a bit more in-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth, as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 10% year-over-year, with installed-base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office Commercial licensing declined 17%, in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to 76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8%, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Growth was driven by Talent Solutions, though we continue to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI Services. While the trends from the prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected growth in our per-user business. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance of Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing 3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand noted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5. Devices revenue decreased 22%, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex-TAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, although search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. In gaming, revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 5 points year-over-year, driven primarily by sales mix-shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 1% and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher than anticipated, driven by interest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. Finally, we returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a U.S. dollar basis. The Activision acquisition closed on October 13. So my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition. Our outlook includes purchase accounting impact, integration, and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately one point. We expect FX to have no impact on COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals. The growth will be impacted by a low growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be relatively flat year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change. Q2 Cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvements in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12%, or $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency. We're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on November 1st, and expect the related revenue to grow gradually over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions. Growth continues to be impacted by the overall market environment for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 18%, or $25.1 billion to $25.4 billion. Revenue growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth continues to be driven by the Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. For H2, assuming the optimization and new workload trends continue, and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly stable compared to Q2. Our on-premises server business is expected to have revenue growth that is roughly flat with continued hybrid demand, particularly from licenses running in multi-cloud environments. In enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline by low-to-mid single digits. Now to more Personal Computing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect revenue of $16.5 billion to $16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be mid-to-high single digits with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be mid-single digits with roughly 4 points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength, supported by Edge browser share gains and increasing Bing engagement, as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. A reminder that this ex-TAC growth will be roughly 4 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high 40s. This includes roughly 35 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition, which as a reminder includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid-to-high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $19.4 billion to $19.6 billion, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.5 billion to $15.6 billion, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million, as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the Activision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now, some additional thoughts on H2 as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact on full-year revenue COGS or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease revenue COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, we expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For full FY '24, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity while also maintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full-year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year. In closing, with our strong start to FY '24, I am confident that as a team we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our commitment to lead the AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.","sentiment":"0.7"}

Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And the new products garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment that remains volatile, and I think investors are getting more concerned about it. So two questions on this: one, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year, or is the environment too tricky for that? And then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation?","sentiment":"0.5"}

Overall, there are multiple things happening simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize where the growth for Azure is coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things occurring in parallel. For example, consider cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are in even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we announced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in a single cloud. We're excited about that. In some sense, the financial services sector is a good example where a lot of Oracle needs to move to the cloud. The second is the workloads start; then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads begin, and that cycle continues. We'll see some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme in the second half of our fiscal year. The third aspect is new workloads starting around AI. Given our leadership position, we are seeing completely new projects form, which are AI projects. AI projects leverage various cloud metrics as well. That gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. On the SaaS side, obviously, again, this is a new product going through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with GitHub Copilot, are giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence in what these products represent in terms of value. We are in the early innings here, and we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.","sentiment":"0.8"}

In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that’s what we're talking about moving into Q2. This speaks to our value proposition, where Satya went. It ensures that customers are realizing a very quick return on value, real productivity improvements, and substantial savings. Therefore, when we're discussing renewal, or talking about E5 upgrades or mentioning AI services, these come with real promises of high-value scenarios. I think that is an important piece regarding stability and commercial demand. Regarding operating leverage, although you're correct that our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we are focused on ensuring every dollar we allocate is directed back toward our priorities of commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave. I believe that focus is really helping with both execution and leverage.","sentiment":"0.6"}

Yes, it's true that we have taken a full stack approach, whether it's ChatGPT, Bing Chat, or all our Copilots, which all share the same model. Essentially, one of the strengths we have is the extensive leverage of the single model we trained, which is applied for inference at scale. This advantage extends down to both internal utilization and the use by third parties. Over time, you can observe optimization across the stack down to the silicon level; as the abstraction layer developers are using is much higher than low-level kernels. Thus, our technical approach involves making Copilots and their complete stack available. That doesn’t exclude training for open-source or proprietary models; fine-tuning, and RLHF takes place as well. However, we possess scale leverage of one substantial model that serves for training and inference across all our first-party SaaS applications and Azure AI services.","sentiment":"0.7"}

Fortunately, we have good news on two fronts: first, 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the product. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Interestingly, the feedback is that it's not any one specific tool; the consensus indicates that users appreciate the full suite of options. They are leveraging the Copilot button across every application—be it Word for document creation, Excel for analysis, PowerPoint, Outlook, or Teams. The intelligent recap feature for Teams, for instance, is not just an ordinary transcript; it acts like a knowledge base of all meetings that can be queried and contribute to the enterprise's knowledge base. We are experiencing broad usage across different functions, whether it's finance or sales, and we are seeing significant productivity gains similar to what we witnessed with developers and GitHub Copilot. Thus far, so good in terms of data and feedback, and we are eagerly anticipating our Ignite conference, where we will delve deeper into various use cases and articulate the value further while providing prescriptive guidance on deployment. Overall, it’s promising to see such a level of usage and excitement around a new product.","sentiment":"0.8"}

You're guiding to a 1 to 2-point deceleration in December and then stable thereafter. However, why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the second half of your fiscal year if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity?

A couple of points: as I discussed concerning Q2 and then into H2, we've been consistently noting that the optimization trends have been stable for us across a couple of quarters. Customers are expected to continue to apply optimization practices, which are a normal part of managing workloads. This is not new. There were certainly some quarters where it was more pronounced. However, that is a pattern inherent to having customers create room for new workload adoption while continuing to develop new capabilities. It’s particularly key to identify that we expect emerging workload starts, and at this scale, stability within our Azure business means we will have numerous new workload starts, primarily driven by AI workloads. AI workloads, as you know, do not solely leverage AI services—they also use data services and other offerings. So, competitively, our execution has been solid, and we feel confident about gaining share going forward, which is why I feel assured about our guidance.","sentiment":"0.6"}

Generally, our seat growth does originate from all segments but has shown particular strength in small and mid-sized businesses as well as the frontline worker opportunity. This continues to be the predominant source of our seat growth over many quarters. Although the growth has seen some slowdown per your point, the fact that we can still add seats at this level reflects the broadening applicability of Microsoft 365, which presents a compelling value proposition to more people. Many have suggested we might have reached saturation given our existing customer base, but we contend that when you expand the definition of what Microsoft 365 offers—including security, analytics, Teams, and various other propositions—it becomes relevant for a wider variety of workers. The value proposition is potent, particularly for small businesses, and many perceive it as an excellent allocation of their expenditures.","sentiment":"0.6"}

I would say a couple of factors were involved here, and it was indeed a strong leverage quarter for the segment. Firstly, the Azure revenue growth and stability we are witnessing absolutely helps with operating leverage. Secondly, within our core Azure business, the team has made thoughtful decisions that improved gross margin across both technical decisions and implementations. Our infrastructure teams have achieved considerable advances in delivering that as well. Of course, on the operating expenses side, there's been a strong focus on maintaining operational efficiency while positioning ourselves for the AI transition with Azure. Even while investing in AI infrastructure—which will and should translate to revenue— expenses should remain manageable, allowing for good margin performance. It’s important to note that we have easier comparisons in Q1 and Q2, given our highest growth operating expense quarters occurred a year ago.","sentiment":"0.6"}

Amy, the Microsoft cloud gross margin is up 2 points year-over-year, excluding the useful life change—more improvement than we've seen for some time.

Let me split this into two components, as both are essential and a good question, Gregg. Concerning our core business—Azure, Office 365, Dynamics, etc.—we continue to deliver year-over-year improvements in gross margin, so that has certainly contributed to this quarter. Furthermore, as Satya mentioned in an earlier question, a consistent infrastructure spanning our platform allows us to optimize our spending according to revenue generated. This means our capital investments, regardless of the utilization—whether at the SaaS level, infrastructure level, or for training workloads—can quickly translate to revenue in our core offerings. Yes, investing in AI will influence COGS growth, but we are focused on securing leverage and ensuring revenue growth keeps pace. At times, you might see one outpace the other by one or two points in a quarter, but overall, we’re committed to maintaining a close alignment.","sentiment":"0.5"}

I'm Spencer Wang, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEOs, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters; and CFO, Spence Neumann. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. With that, we will now take questions that have been submitted by the analyst community. And we'll begin first with some questions about paid membership reporting in our results and forecast. So for our first question, it comes from Justin Patterson of KeyBanc. And I'll direct this at Greg initially. Greg, could you please talk about the decision to stop reporting quarterly membership and ARM data in 2025? Why eliminate this?

As we noted in the letter, we've evolved and we're going to continue to evolve developing our revenue model and adding things like advertising and our extra member feature, things that aren't directly connected to a number of members. We've also evolved our pricing and plans with multiple tiers, different price points across different countries. I think those price points are going to become increasingly different. So each incremental member has a different business impact. And all of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business. So this change is really motivated by wanting to focus on what we see as the key metrics that we think matter most to the business. So we're going to report and guide on revenue, on OI, OI margin, net income, EPS, free cash flow. We'll add a new annual guidance on our revenue range to give you a little bit more of a long-term view. We'll also - we're not going to be silent on members as well. We'll periodically update when we grow and we hit certain major milestones, we'll announce those. It's just not going to be part of our regular reporting. And we want to do all of this thoughtfully and give everyone time to adjust this transition. So we're going to continue to report subscribers until Q1 of next year, which links into our next annual revenue guidance for 2025. So we think that provides some long-range continuity. And we expect that will provide an effective bridge and transition. But ultimately, we think this is a better approach that reflects the evolution of the business and it more matches and is consistent with how we manage internally to engagement, revenue, and profit.","sentiment":"0.6"}

And on engagement, Greg, just a reminder, we currently report our engagement on our biannual engagement report, leading the industry in viewing transparency and granularity. And we're going to look into building on that both in granularity, which will be kind of tough. Our current report covers about 99% of the viewing on Netflix, but we'll look at the regularity in different ways that we can make it even easier to track our progress on engagement. And - but importantly, why we focus on engagement is because we believe it's the single best indicator of member satisfaction with our offering, and it is a leading indicator for retention and acquisition over time. So happy members watch more, they stick around longer, they tell friends, which all grows engagement, revenue, and profit, our North Stars.

I would say, the thing we're doing is we're thrilling our members. That's the thing we set out there to talk about why we all bounce out of bed in the morning. I look at this last quarter, eight of the first 11 weeks of the year, we've had the number one film on streaming. Nine of the first 11 weeks, we've had the number one original series. And I'm talking about hits like Avatar: The Last Airbender, Griselda, Damsel, Love Is Blind, 3 Body Problem, all of that just in the last few months. So this consistent and dependable and expected drumbeat of hit shows, films, and games, that's the business that we're in. And that's what we have to do every day and we have to do it all over the world. So if you think about that and how we're doing about kind of quality at scale in multiple cultures in multiple regions, I look at this last quarter, you see Fool Me Once, One Day, Gentleman, Scoop, The Super-Buzzy, Baby Reindeer, all that from the U.K., all in the last few months. Berlin, Society of the Snow, Alpha Males, all from Spain and all just in the last few months. So that's been one of those things that we just keep building and building and building on. And local unscripted, which is a fairly new initiative for us, and we're finding huge success with things like our second season of Physical 100 in Korea recently and Love is Blind, Sweden. These are all kind of hard to replicate things that we keep getting better and better at every day that we're really proud of the teams for doing that. So - and remember, engagement captures all of this and none of that is possible without great tech and product. We need to do both.","sentiment":"0.9"}

The fundamental is all those amazing series, film, games, live events, but a key component of our success and something that we're seeking to get constantly better at is that ability to find audiences for all those great titles. Part of making that happen is just the number of people who look to us for entertainment. We mentioned over 0.5 billion people in this letter, but part of that is that, that product we do to effectively connect those folks with titles that they will love, which then enables us to find the largest audiences for those titles that we think that they could get anywhere. And I think as you mentioned, Ted, this applies globally to titles from all over the world, which is super-exciting. So - and then, of course, we seek to maximize the fandom and the impact on the conversation and the cultural zeitgeist that all those titles have. And when we do that well, that just feeds positively into that cycle as we launch new titles. So in terms of what are we doing better, what do we do better, we seek to get better at all of those things.

Secondly, he also has a question about second quarter subscriber growth. Will that be higher or lower than Q2 of 2023?","sentiment":"0.2"}

Sure. Well, thanks for the question. So first, regarding revenue growth overall, full year outlook, I feel really good about where we are in our growth outlook. So I just want to be clear about that. We've done a lot of hard work over the past 18 months or so to reaccelerate the business and reaccelerate revenue through a combination of improving our core service, which Greg and Ted just talked about and rolling out paid sharing, launching our ads business and that reacceleration really started in the back half of '23 and it built through the year. So our growth in the back half of '24 is really kind of comping off of those harder comps. And at the high end of our revenue forecast, our growth in the second half is consistent with our growth in the first half, even with those tougher comps. And it's still early in the year. We still got a lot to execute against. We also, as you see in our letter, there's been some FX that with the strengthening dollar, that's a bit of a headwind. So we'll see where that goes throughout the year. But we're guiding a healthy double-digit revenue growth for the full year, which is what we set out to deliver and that's what's reflected in the range. And I guess maybe it's in the question, I guess, seeded and this is a little bit of like what's really kind of the outlook for our growth of the business, not just the back half of this year, but into '25. And it's too early to provide real - specific guidance, but we're going to work hard to sustain healthy double-digit revenue growth for our business. And we really like the kind of the opportunity ahead of us. We're so small in every aspect. We're only 6% roughly of our revenue opportunity. We're lesser than 10% of TV share in every country in which we operate. There's still hundreds of millions of homes that are not Netflix members and we're just getting started on advertising. So the key is to, as you just heard from Greg and Ted, continually improve our service, drive more engagement, more member value. As we do that, we'll have more members. We'll be able to occasionally price in that value and also have a big highly engaged audience for advertisers. So more to come on '25 guidance, but that's - we feel good about the outlook. And then, I guess the second part of the question, I'm trying to remember Spencer. I'm sorry.","sentiment":"0.5"}

I'll jump in. Others can chime in as well. But when you think about the outlook for the year, it's in terms of the mix of revenue growth. It's kind of pretty similar to - we expect it will be pretty similar to what you see in Q1 where it's primarily driven by member growth because of the kind of the full year impact of paid sharing rolling through the year and continued strong acquisition and retention trends. But you are - we are seeing some ARM growth as well. We saw it in Q1, about 1% on a reported basis, 4% FX-neutral. And what's - I just want to be clear, what's happening is that with ARM is price changes are going well. And that's why we're seeing those strong acquisition retention trends because it's a testament to the strength of our slate, the overall improvement in the value of our service. But we've only really changed prices in a few big markets and that was U.S., U.K., France late last year. And only on some of the planned tiers in those markets, not even all the planned tiers. And since then, it's been mostly pretty small countries other than Argentina. And Argentina, as you can see, we're sort of pricing into the local currency devaluation and you see that in the difference between FX-neutral and reported growth in Q1. So mostly, what you're seeing in our growth profile this year is the fact that we haven't taken pricing in most countries for the past two years really. And we also have some ARM kind of headwinds in the near term that you see in Q1. You'll probably see throughout most of this year, which is that one, we have some this planned mix shift as we roll out paid sharing. So while it's highly revenue accretive, as you can see in our numbers and our reported growth - strong reported growth in Q1 and outlook for the year, that growth - as we spin off into new paid memberships, they tend to spin off into a mix of planned tiers that's a little bit of a lower price view than what we see in our tenured members. And we're also growing our ads tier at a nice clip as you've seen. I'm sure we'll talk about it and monetization is lagging growth there. I'm sure we'll talk about that a bit as well. We also have some country mix shifts. So that whole combination of factors results in pretty modest ARM growth, still some ARM growth, but pretty modest in Q1 and probably throughout the year. But again, the key there is that this is all we're kind of managing this business transition in a way that's really healthy for overall revenue growth as you see with 15% reported revenue growth in the quarter, strong outlook for the year and we're building into a much more kind of durable and healthy foundation for revenue growth going forward across a larger base of paid members and a really kind of strong and scaled highly engaged audience to build into our advertising over time and a strong paid sharing solution and also to kind of penetrate into those households. So we'll increasingly kind of see that mix in our revenue growth and we start to see some of it this year.","sentiment":"0.6"}

Our focus is on sustaining healthy revenue growth and growing margins each year. That's what we talk about a lot of we also talked about in the letter. And we feel good about what we've been delivering, 21% margins last year, that's up from 18% in the year before. And now, we're targeting 25% this year, which is up a tick from the start of year when we were guiding to 24%. So I'd say, just like we have in the past, we'll take a disciplined approach to balancing margin improvement with investing into our growth. We've managed that balance historically pretty well, growing content investment, growing profit, growing profit margin and growing cash flow. You should expect we'll continue to do that, but the amount of annual margin expansion in any given year could bounce around a bit with FX and other investment opportunities. But again, we're committed to grow margin each year. And we see a lot of runway to continue to grow profit and profit margin over the long term.","sentiment":"0.5"}

As we mentioned last quarter, we're at the point where we've operationalized the pay sharing work. So this is just now part of that standard mechanism that we've been building and iterating on over time to translate more entertainment value and great film, series, games, live events into revenue. And like we do with all of the significant parts of our product experience, we're iterating on that, testing it, improving it continually. So rather than thinking beyond sort of specific cohorts or specific numbers, we really think about this more as developing more mechanisms, more effective ways to convert folks who are interacting with us, whether they be borrowers or folks that were members before that are coming back, we call them rejoiners or folks that have never been a Netflix member. So we want to find the right call to action, the right offer, the right nudge at the right time to get them to convert. And just to be clear, we still see opportunities to improve this process. We've got line of sight on several improvements to this value translation mechanism that we expect will deliver and contribute to business growth for the next several quarters to come. But I also very much believe that just like for the last 15 years, we've always found something to improve in this process. And even beyond those, for years and decades to come, we'll be working on this and making it better and better and better. So all of those improvements could allow us to effectively get more of that 500 million plus smart TV households to sign up and become members. Spence mentioned hundreds of millions yet to come. This is a way to effectively get at more of those folks and make them part of our membership base. And as we mentioned earlier on the call too, I think worth noting that while we're fully anticipating continue to grow subs, the overall business growth now has extra levers and extra drivers like plan optimization, including things like extra members, ads revenue, pricing into more value, which is important. So those levers are also an increasingly important part of our growth model as well.","sentiment":"0.6"}

I'll move us on now to a series of questions around advertising. The first of which comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. What are the most important drivers of scaling your ad tier when you think about adjustments you could make to pricing and plans, partner bundles and marketing? How do you get people over the hump for a - that a few minutes of ads an hour can still be a very good experience at the right price? Greg, why don't you take that one?","sentiment":"0.1"}

And I would say we're generally taking our entire playbook, everything that we've learned about how do you grow members and we're applying it to our ads tier now. So clearly, that means partner channels, it means device integrations, bundles, integrated payments. Those are all important tools for growth just as they are and will continue to be in our non-ads offering, increasing awareness of the quality of our ads experience, especially relative to the linear TV ads experience, which in many countries is really quite poor. That's an important and iterative tool when we talk about sort of marketing and awareness building that's, that's going to be part of our growth mechanism. Low price, that's important to consumers. $6.99 is an example in the United States for multiple streams, full HD downloads. We think that's a great entertainment value, especially at the industry-leading low ad load that we've got. So that's critical as well. So I think you can see the results of leveraging all of these mechanisms and more and how our ads tier has been scaling over the last couple of quarters. So we're 65% up quarter-to-quarter this last quarter. That's after two quarters of about 70% quarter-over-quarter growth. For me, it's exciting to see that growth rate stay high even as we've grown the base so much because obviously, the numbers indicate. That means that there's more absolute additions each quarter. So we're making good progress there. But look, we've got much, much more to do in terms of scaling. We've got more to do in terms of effective go-to-market, more technical features, more ads products. There's plenty of work ahead for us on ads.","sentiment":"0.7"}

Our next question on advertising comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed. He has a three-part question. Part one, can you update us on your thinking around the optimal spread between the ad tier and the ad-free tier? Secondly, is your advertising ARPU, excluding the subscription fee, up meaningfully versus your original comments that it was in the $8 to $9 range last year?

I'll take the first one and then maybe hand the ARPU/ARM points to Spence. We don't have a fixed operator position on sort of the optimal pricing spread. And much like we've done with price changes in general, we really use signals from our customers, things like plan take rate, conversion rates and churn to guide us along an iterative path to get to that right pricing. And I think it's also probably worth noting that sort of right pricing is not really a static position. As we continue to evolve and improve our offering, that's going to change as well. But I think a good general guideline for us in the long term is that it would be healthy for us to land overall monetization between our ads and non-ads offerings in roughly an equivalent position. So it really comes down to what works best for any given member. And it's really a member choice about which plan they think serves them the best. And then I'll hand it over to Spence on ARM questions.","sentiment":"0.4"}

Thanks, Greg. So in terms of ARM and your question, Rich, in terms of how we're doing now relative to what we discussed when we first launched the business. And as Greg said, we've been growing our inventory at quite a fast clip. And so, monetization hasn't fully kept up with that growth in scale and inventory, as we're still early in building out our sales capabilities and our ad products. But that is an opportunity for us, because we're still a very premium content environment, a very highly engaged audience that's at an increasing scale. So our CPMs remain strong and we're building out our capabilities, as Greg talked about. So the revenue is going to follow engagement over time, and it's already kind of growing nicely, which is great just off a small base. So then really, as Greg said, what that means for ARM is right now, it is a bit of a drag on our ARM because of we're kind of under-monetizing relative to supply. But over time, we expect to be similar in revenue on our ads tier, a combination of subscription as well as ads revenue with those kind of non-ads offering. So that's how to think about it, but we're building to it over time.","sentiment":"0.5"}

And brand new original series and limited series like American Primeval from Pete Berg, Heartburn with an all-star cast, Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber, Senna, which is this great limited series on the Great Brazilian Formula One Driver that we're really excited about.

We've got great engagement from our members on our ads tier. We've got an opportunity to grow that even further. We think that's connected again to the power of those titles. We're rapidly growing scale, as we mentioned. That's the number one request we've had from advertisers. So that's exciting. We're making progress on technical features like measurement, on ads products. So we're excited to get that out there. And really, this is just an opportunity to bring all of that progress in a package to advertisers and then of course, to get input from them because we know that they're going to have comments and they're going to have things that they're going to want us to continue to work on.

On-demand and streaming have been unbelievable for consumer choice and control. And it's really put the controls of television back in the hands of consumers, which has been really phenomenal. But there's also something incredibly magic about folks gathering around the TV together in the living room to watch something all at the same time.

We have - beyond the fight itself, we have several nights of live comedy coming from the Netflix Is A Joke Festival next month and starting in January, we've got 52 weeks of live sports with WWE RAW that's going to be coming to our members every week on Netflix. And we think it's going to be a real value-add to watch those things in real time. And we're going to continue to try a lot of new things, but the core of it is, do our members love it? And judging from the early excitement around the Jake Paul, Mike Tyson fight, there's going to be a lot of people waking up in the middle of the night all over the world to watch this fight in real time.","sentiment":"0.8"}

And I think that's the core of everything we do in all kinds of programming, including sports. So our North Star is to grow engagement, revenue, and profit. And if we find opportunities we can drive all three of those, we will do that across an increasingly wide variety of quality entertainment. So when and if those opportunities arrive that we can come in and do that, which we feel like we did in our deal with WWE. If we can repeat those dynamics and other things, including sports, we'll look at them for sure. So I think it's - we have the benefit of building an enormous business without a loss leader. And we continue to believe that we can grow on that path just as you've seen. So I think the core of it is that we're going to look at those opportunities with the same discipline that we do when we talk to movie producers and television networks about putting our content on the air.","sentiment":"0.6"}

The next question comes from Rich Greenfield from LightShed about our film strategy. So for Ted, a recent New York Times article cited internal communications from new Netflix film Chief, Dan Lin stating quote. The aim is to make Netflix's movies better, cheaper, and less frequent. Lin wants his team to become more aggressive producers developing their own material rather than waiting for projects from producers and agents that come to them unquote. Everyone wants to make better, cheaper films, but we find it hard to believe that, being rich, find it hard to believe that there is a magic formula. Help us understand the strategy shift under Dan Lin versus Scott Stuber.","sentiment":"0.1"}

I would send you back to that New York Times article because that was not a quote from Dan. And I would say that nor did we participate in that article. I would say, just to be clear, there is no appetite to make fewer films. But there is an unlimited appetite to make better films always, even though we have made and we are making great films. We want to make them better, of course. We're super excited to have Dan join the company. He just joined us running 100 miles an hour. Bella has said this publicly that our strategy remains variety and quality. And she's doing an amazing job of bringing new fresh thinking to our content and our content organization, bringing Dan on board is a great example of that. We want to have a lot of movies. We want them to thrill our audiences and they all have different tastes and we want them all to be great. And so, we take a very audience-centric view of what quality is. Dan knows that from having produced for us as the CEO, Ride Back, he produced the Oscar-nominated film, The Two Popes. For us, he did Avatar: The Last Airbender for us recently. So he understands Netflix and the audience really, really well and his success in live action and animation is very hard to define in the business. So we're thrilled he's doing it here.","sentiment":"0.6"}

I know I just said this 10 minutes ago, but I'm going to repeat it. Eight of the first 11 weeks of this year, we've had the number one movie and nine of the last 11 weeks of this year, we've had the number one series. And that's according to the Nielsen streaming data. And for us, that is what we're personally focused on.

So when you see our next engagement report, you are going to see some impact to our overall absolute view hours as a result of that. But despite that impact and despite the general pressure from strong competition that Ted noted, we think our engagement remains healthy. You can see it in the stat that Ted indicated in terms of the Nielsen ratings and our modest growth in TV time in the United States, but we also wanted to do an apples-to-apples view of engagement. So we looked at the population not impacted by paid sharing, it will be called owner households. And in Q1 of '24, the hours viewed per account were steady with the year-ago quarter. So that's a pretty good sign that our engagement is holding up and it sort of cuts through the noise around paid sharing. And again, I just want to reiterate, we think we have plenty of room to grow engagement, right? We're still less than 10% of TV hours, even in our most mature markets. So there's tons of room for growth ahead of us.","sentiment":"0.6"}

We don't have a set position on a ceiling. I mean, I'm sure you can look at pay TV as a potential marker for where people have spent before, but we really actually don't think of it so much as defined by that. We see it as an opportunity to continue the process that we've been working on, which is let's continue to try and invest wisely, add more entertainment value. And as we add more entertainment value, then of course, we can go back to our subscribers and ask them to pay a little bit more to keep that virtuous cycle moving. And really the markers for us in terms of the upside potential are more around the hours on TV that we are winning, how many moments of truth we call it that we are winning. Again, less than 10% in our even most mature markets, there's tons of room there. You can use total consumer spend on entertainment in the markets and categories that we compete in. That's between 5% and 6%. So there's just a lot of runway still ahead of us to go do a good job at making that investment happen, deliver more value, and then ask folks to pay a little bit more.","sentiment":"0.5"}

We've now started that process in Canada and the U.K. and very similar to what you saw us do with paid sharing, we're going to work hard to make this a smooth transition. Part of that is listening to our members before we make any further moves. So we've got nothing more to announce and we really want to see how this goes. Yes. We know that this is a change for our basic members, but we think we've got a strong offering for them. They're going to get more for less, two streams versus one, we've got higher definition, we've got downloads, all at a lower price.

Thanks for the question. It's really quite a modest evolution of our capital allocation strategy to better reflect our investment-grade status. And that's really what it is. We're still going to have the same financial policies and principles in terms of prioritizing profitable growth by reinvesting in our core business, maintaining a healthy balance sheet with ample liquidity and returning excess cash beyond several billion dollars on the balance sheet of minimum cash and anything that we use for selective M&A to return to shareholders through share repurchase. So really the only change is that now that we're solidly investment grade, we're going to - while we will hold still several billion dollars in cash on the balance sheet, we won't have the same marker of two months of revenue - the equivalent of two months of revenue on the balance sheet. So it allows us to be a bit more efficient there. We also upsized our revolver, which was announced today, up to $3 billion from $1 billion, which also gives us more access to capital and better cash efficiency. And then again, any cash beyond that, we'll return to shareholders. We've historically been mostly a build versus buy company with select strategic kind of acceleration through M&A. And that there's nothing right now planned, but that still is kind of our philosophy is to build predominantly. And we're also going to kind of refinance our existing kind of debt as those maturities approach, but we don't plan to kind of lever up through stock buyback. We want to - we really do value that balance sheet flexibility.","sentiment":"0.5"}

Thank you, Spence. Last question on capital allocation for you. This comes from Vikram of Baird. What are your latest thoughts on the appropriate level of content spend for the business beyond 2024?

It still holds. It still holds. So still basically the short of it is we're really kind of managing to that. So as we said, we've been like - we've been focused on driving that acceleration of our revenue growth, continuing to grow our business, and grow our profitability. As we do that, we would expect to continue to grow our content investment as we have historically into the highest impact areas, but also be quite disciplined there. So we want to grow our free cash flow. So we believe we can manage to that roughly 1.1 times of cash content spend relative to expense on the P&L and that leads to overall revenue growth, increased profit, profit margins, growing free cash flow. And that still gives us a lot of opportunity to spend into all those kind of content and entertainment categories that Greg and Ted have been talking about.","sentiment":"0.5"}

What are the choices and how much time do they have. So our version of short-form is more like giving our members the ability to watch 10 minutes of an episode of a series that they're binging right now if they only have 10 minutes. But some and those when I look at the short-form viewing on YouTube and TikTok, some of it is adjacent and quite complementary to our viewing. So our trailers or creators expressing their fandom for our shows like doing posting a Wednesday Dance or Ugly Crying, Watching One Day, all those kind of things that become viral sensations and actually increase the fandom of our shows. Now that being said, some of that viewing is directly competitive with us, the same as it is with other media companies who provide content to YouTube by way of example. The art of this has always been finding the right balance of both. So and also would point out that these platforms have been a way to have new voices emerge, and we've got our eye on them as well to try to develop them into the next generation of great storytellers on Netflix.","sentiment":"0.5"}

And we also think we're well-positioned to be in the vanguard of adoption and application of those new approaches from our just general capabilities that we've developed and how we've already developed systems that do all these things. We also think that we have the opportunity to develop and deliver new tools to creators to allow them to tell their stories in even more compelling ways. That's great for them. It's great for the stories and it's great for our members. And what should storytellers be focused on. I think storytellers should be focused on great storytelling. It is incredibly hard and incredibly complex to deliver thrilling stories through film, through series, through games.

Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year, both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day, and we're seeing healthy growth in the U.S. I want to call out WhatsApp specifically, where the number of daily active users and messages sent in the U.S. keeps gaining momentum, and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and metaverse efforts, which will be the focus of my comments today. So let's start with AI. We're building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business on our platform will eventually use to help customers buy things and get customer support. We're also developing internal coding and development AIs, as well as hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs, and a lot more. Last week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI, which is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3. Our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service in terms of both quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have tried it and feedback is very positive. When I checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback was that people wanted us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English-speaking countries and will roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it, and then once we think it's ready, we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall, and with this release, we are now moving to the next growth phase of our playbook. We believe Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use. We're making it easier for a lot of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook. In addition to answering more complex queries, a few other unique features from this release include Meta AI's ability to create animations from still images and generate high-quality images quickly—so fast that it can create and update them as you type. I've seen many people commenting about that experience online, expressing how they've never experienced anything like it before. Regarding the core AI model and intelligence powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400-plus billion parameter model we’re still training appears on track to be industry-leading on several benchmarks. I expect that our models will only improve further with open-source contributions. Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as a key milestone in demonstrating that we have the talent, data, and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services. This leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. As we scale CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. Realistically, even with directing much of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we realize revenue from these new products. It's worth mentioning that we've historically seen volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, when we invest in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We've seen this with Reels and Stories as newsfeed transitioned to mobile, among others. I also expect a multi-year investment cycle before we fully scale Meta AI, business AIs, and more into the profitable services I anticipate. Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stayed with us. The initial signs are quite positive here, too. However, building the leading AI will be a larger undertaking than previous experiences we've added to our apps, likely requiring several years. Once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay for larger AI models and more compute access. Additionally, AI is already helping us improve app engagement, leading to more ads and improved ad delivery to offer more value. If technology and products evolve as we hope, each of these factors will unlock massive amounts of value for people and businesses over time. We're seeing solid progress on these efforts already. Currently, about 30% of posts in Facebook feeds are delivered by our AI recommendation system, up 2x from the previous couple of years. For the first time, more than 50% of the content users see on Instagram is AI-recommended. AI has also been integral in enhancing the value we create for advertisers by showing users more relevant ads. If you consider our two end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, revenue from those tools has more than doubled compared to last year. We'll continue to remain focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services. Some efficiencies will come from improving how we train and run models, while some improvements will stem from the open-source community, particularly in cost efficiency as we saw with Open Compute. We're also making progress on developing more of our silicon. Our Meta training and inference accelerator chip has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations-related workloads on this cheaper stack. As this program matures over the upcoming years, we aim to expand this to more of our workloads as well. Of course, as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to manage headcount and other expense growth throughout the company carefully. Beyond our AI work, another focus is the metaverse. It's intriguing how these two themes have converged. This is clearest when we look at glasses. I used to think AR glasses wouldn't become a mainstream product until we developed full holographic displays—and I still think that's going to be awesome. However, it now seems evident that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display. Glasses provide an ideal device for an AI assistant because they can perceive what you see and hear, offering full context on your surroundings as they assist with your tasks. The launch this week of Meta AI integrating Vision on the glasses is a good example, allowing you to ask questions about what you’re looking at. One strategic dynamic I've been considering is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work is shifting toward supporting our AI efforts. We currently report our financials as two distinct segments—Family of Apps and Reality Labs—but strategically, I consider them fundamentally the same business. Reality Labs' vision is to build the next generation of computing platforms, primarily to establish the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we will need to find better ways to articulate the value generated across both segments, so it doesn't just appear that our hardware costs are increasing as our glasses ecosystem scales with all value flowing to a different segment. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses built in partnership with Essilor Luxottica continue to perform well and are sold out in various styles and colors. We're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as possible. We just launched the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine, and generally, I'm optimistic about our plan of starting with classic designs and expanding with a growing diversity of options over time. If we want everyone to access wearable AI, eyewear differs from phones or watches because people desire diverse designs. Our collaboration with leading eyewear brands will help us address a larger market. I believe a similar open ecosystem approach will aid us in expanding the virtual and mixed reality headset market over time as well. We announced the opening of Meta Horizon OS, the operating system powering Quest. As the ecosystem grows, I believe there will be a sufficient diversity in how individuals utilize mixed reality, driving demand for more designs than we can build in-house. For instance, a work-focused headset may require specific design attributes to connect to a laptop, while a fitness-focused headset might prioritize lightweight, sweat-wicking materials. An entertainment-focused headset might emphasize the highest resolution displays, while a gaming-focused headset could focus on peripherals and haptics, possibly bundled with Xbox controllers and a game pass subscription. I think that our first-party Quest devices will remain the most popular headsets, and we will continue to focus on advancing state-of-the-art technology and making it accessible to all. However, I also believe that opening our ecosystem and operating system will accelerate the growth of the broader mixed reality ecosystem. We're also observing positive improvements across our apps. I have mentioned some of the most important trends already, including WhatsApp growth in the U.S. and AI-powered recommendations in our feeds and reels. However, I want to highlight that video remains a bright spot. This month, we launched an updated full-screen video player on Facebook, unifying reels, longer videos, and live content into a single experience with a cohesive recommendation system. On Instagram, reels and video continue to drive engagement, with reels now constituting 50% of the time spent within the app. Threads is also seeing solid growth, with over 150 million monthly active users; we're on track with the trajectory I hoped for. And, of course, my daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift is now on Threads, a significant development in my household. Overall, I am proud of the progress we've made thus far this year. We have much more execution ahead to capitalize on the opportunities before us. A huge thank you to our teams for driving these advancements and to all of you for being on this journey with us. Now here is Susan.","sentiment":"0.8"}

Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, reflecting a 27% increase on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year. In terms of specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9% due mainly to higher infrastructure-related costs, partially offset by lapping Reality Labs' inventory-related valuation adjustments. R&D grew 6%, primarily driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs, offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales expenses decreased 16% mainly due to reduced restructuring costs, professional services, and marketing expenditure. General and administrative expenses increased by 20%, as higher legal-related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. We closed the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4. First quarter operating income reached $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%, with a net income of $12.4 billion, or $4.71 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, totaled $6.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow stood at $12.5 billion, and we repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock, along with $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, concluding the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. Moving to our segment results, I'll start with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with about 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps daily in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $36 billion, a 27% year-over-year increase. Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, also up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media. Geographically, ad revenue growth was strongest in the Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 33%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 25%, and North America grew 22%. In Q1, we saw a 20% increase in total ad impressions served across our services, while the average price per ad rose by 6%. Impression growth was mainly fueled by Asia Pacific and Rest of World, while pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and services. Family of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85%, driven by business messaging revenue growth on our WhatsApp business platform. We're continuing to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses totaled $18.4 billion, accounting for approximately 81% of our overall expenses, which were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure costs, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, reflecting a 49% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30%, driven mainly by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher headcount-related expenses were significantly offset by inventory-related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion. Turning to our business outlook, two primary factors drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. We're pleased with our engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to enhance engagement on our platform, demonstrating that people find added value in discovering content from accounts they're not connected to. The level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we've improved these systems, and we see further opportunities to increase relevance and personalization of recommendations as we enhance our models. Video continues to grow across our platform, now representing more than 60% of total time on both Facebook and Instagram. Reels remains the primary driver of that growth, and we are progressing on our initiative to unify Reels, longer-form video, and live video into a single experience on Facebook. In April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the U.S. and Canada, increasingly powered by our next-generation ranking architecture, which we expect will yield more relevant video recommendations over time. We're also introducing deeper integrations of generative AI into our apps in the U.S. and over a dozen other countries. Along with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in search within our apps, as well as in Facebook feeds and groups. We expect these integrations will support our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people explore their interests while Meta AI allows them to delve deeper into topics of interest. Threads continues to gain traction, as we keep shipping valuable features and scaling the community. Now for the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. There are two components to this work. The first focuses on optimizing ad levels within organic engagement. Here, we continue to enhance our understanding of user preferences for viewing ads, allowing us to optimize the right time, place, and audience to show an ad. For instance, we are improving our ability to adjust ad placement and quantity in real-time based on user interest and ad content to minimize disruption from ads while innovating on new and creative ad formats. We expect to continue this work while prioritizing surfaces with relatively lower monetization levels, such as video and messaging, as additional growth opportunities. The second component involves enhancing marketing performance. AI is playing an increasingly central role in these efforts. We are continuously improving our ad modeling to deliver superior performance for advertisers. One example is our new ads ranking architecture, Meta Lattice, which we rolled out broadly last year. This architecture allows us to operate significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces, replacing numerous smaller, specialized ad models that were previously optimized for individual objectives. This leads to enhanced efficiency by operating fewer models while simultaneously improving ad performance. Another way we leverage AI is by providing greater automation for advertisers. Through our Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate aspects of the campaign setup process, such as selecting ad creatives, or fully automate their campaigns using our end-to-end automation tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app ads. We are witnessing increasing adoption of these solutions and anticipate driving further uptake throughout 2024 while applying insights gained to our broader ads investments. Now, turning to our approach to capital allocation. We continue to see compelling investment opportunities that will not only enhance our core business in the near term but also help us capture substantial long-term opportunities in generative AI and Reality Labs. As we develop more advanced and compute-intensive recommendation models and scale our capacity for generative AI training and inference needs, we believe ensuring adequate infrastructure capacity will be crucial in realizing many of these opportunities. Therefore, we intend to significantly increase infrastructure investments over the coming years. We are also making substantial ongoing investments in Reality Labs. Our AI initiatives have increasingly intersected with our Reality Labs efforts. For instance, with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, individuals in the U.S. and Canada can now use our multimodal Meta AI assistant for daily tasks without needing to pull out their phones. In the long run, we expect generative AI to play a more significant role in our mixed reality products, simplifying the development of immersive experiences. Expanding our AI initiatives will help ensure we provide the optimal version of our services as we transition to the next computing platform. We plan to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline and believe our robust financial position will enable us to support these investments while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Moreover, we continue to monitor a dynamic regulatory landscape, including potential regulatory headwinds in the EU and U.S. that may significantly affect our business and financial results. We also have a jury trial scheduled for June concerning a lawsuit initiated by the state of Texas regarding our use of facial recognition technology, which could lead to a material loss. Now, to the revenue outlook: we expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to range from $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency presents a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning to the expense outlook: we expect full year 2024 total expenses to range from $96 million to $99 billion, updated from our previous outlook of $94 million to $99 billion due to increased infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we anticipate operating losses will rise significantly year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to scale our ecosystem. For the CapEx outlook, we foresee our full year 2024 capital expenditures to be between $35 billion and $40 billion, increased from our previous range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we accelerate investments in infrastructure to support our AI roadmap. Although we aren't issuing guidance beyond 2024, we expect CapEx to continue to rise next year as we invest heavily to support our ambitious AI research and product development initiatives. Regarding taxes, barring changes to our tax landscape, we anticipate our full year 2024 tax rate will fall in the mid-teens. In conclusion, Q1 marked a positive start to the year. We are experiencing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and making significant progress on our long-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives, which have the potential to transform how people interact with our services in the coming years.","sentiment":"0.5"}

Regarding the timing, it's somewhat challenging to extrapolate from previous cycles. The key takeaway is that it usually takes us a few years, potentially a little more or a little less, to focus on building out and scaling products. Typically, we don't prioritize monetization of new areas until they achieve significant scale, as it's much more effective to improve monetization on other aspects before these new products reach scale. We enter a phase where savvy investors see that the product is scaling and that there is a clear monetizable opportunity even before revenue materializes. We've seen this with Reels and Stories and the transition to mobile, where we first build out the inventory and then monetize it. Sometimes, during the scaling phase of a product, it's not only the case that we're not generating income from it, but it can also displace revenue generated from other areas. This was evident with Reels, where it scaled, but there was a period when it wasn't profitable until it became so later. This analogy is a reminder that we should look at the consumer products' scaling. Meta AI has recently launched meaningfully, so we don't yet have solid statistics to share on its performance. For this year, and probably much of next year, my focus remains on growing Meta AI and other AI products and their engagement. If those products are on a solid growth trajectory, they will likely evolve into very substantial businesses.","sentiment":"0.4"}

To your first question about leveraging and improving our recommendation models to boost engagement, historically, each recommendation product, including Reels and in-feed recommendations, has utilized its own AI model. Recently, we've started developing a new model architecture designed to power multiple recommendation products. We began partially validating this model last year using it for Facebook Reels, where we saw meaningful performance gains, with an 8% to 10% increase in watch time. This year, we plan to extend the singular model architecture to recommend content across Facebook Reels, and its video tab as well. While it’s still early to share specific results, we are optimistic that this new model architecture will lead to increasingly relevant video recommendations in time. On the advertising side, we discussed the new model architecture, Meta Lattice, that we rolled out last year, which consolidates smaller, specialized models into larger ones that can learn what characteristics improve ad performance across multiple services. This has led to enhanced ad performance as we deployed it across Facebook and Instagram in support of various objectives. In 2024, we aim to further enhance model performance and support even more objectives like web, app and ROAS. We're investing significantly in the underlying model architecture for organic engagement and ads, expecting to see continuous improvements in ad performance. Regarding your second question about getting advertisers to try and adopt generative AI tools, we have two aspects. The short-term focus is on generative AI ad creative features we’ve integrated into our ad creation tools. The adoption of these features has varied across verticals and advertiser sizes. Notably, we’ve seen considerable uptake of image expansion among small businesses, and this will remain a significant priority for us in 2024. I expect enhancements to our underlying foundational models will improve the quality of generated outputs and support new features. Currently, we have features supporting text variations, image expansion, and background generation, and we're working continuously to enhance their performance for advertisers to create personalized ads at scale. The long-term focus is on business AIs. We are testing the ability for businesses to implement AIs for business messaging that represent them in customer chats—starting with shopping use cases, such as responding to inquiries about a product or its availability. We are in early stages, testing this with a handful of businesses on Messenger and WhatsApp, receiving positive feedback from businesses claiming the AIs saved them considerable time, while consumers noted quicker response times. We're learning from these tests to enhance AI performance over time and will expand these tests over the coming months, ensuring we address the requirements effectively before broader availability.","sentiment":"0.3"}

Thanks, Mark. Reels revenue continues to grow across Instagram and Facebook in Q1, driven by heightened engagement and enhanced monetization efficiency through improvements in our ads ranking and delivery. As stated previously, we don't plan on quantifying the impact from Reels going forward but it remains a valuable contributor to our overall revenue. We expect ongoing performance improvements and growth in supply. On performance improvements, we are investing in continuous ranking enhancements and making ads easier to interact with through efforts like optimizing calls to action and post-click experiences, especially crucial for direct response performance. We’re also optimizing ads to feel more native to Reels. In Q1, we rolled out our generative AI image expansion tools across Facebook and Instagram Reels after its introduction in Instagram feed in Q4, seeing considerable adoption from small businesses. We’re optimistic about the potential to keep enhancing ad performance. Despite an increase in Reels ad loads over the past year, it remains lower on a per-time basis than both Feed and Stories. We will continue to seek opportunities to grow it thoughtfully and invest in inventive ways to address structural supply constraints of Reels, especially considering its video-heavy format, including implementing higher density experiences and formats and increasing ad load personalization to ensure we're reaching people when they're most likely to be engaged. Regarding China, growth in spending from Chinese advertisers remained strong in Q1, predominantly fueled by online commerce and gaming sectors. This trend is evident in the Asia Pacific advertising segment, which was the fastest-growing region at 41% year-over-year in Q1. We witnessed robust growth across other geographies as well, including a 6-point acceleration in total revenue growth from North American advertisers. While we aren’t quantifying Q1 contributions from China, we recognize we’re lapping strong demand periods anticipated throughout 2024, given the recovery of China-based advertisers from prior pandemic-driven obstacles.","sentiment":"0.4"}

Regarding Advantage+, we continue seeing solid traction across our Advantage+ portfolio, including both solutions that automate individual steps of campaign creation and those that provide full end-to-end automation. For example, the single-step automation product, Advantage+ audience, has experienced significant growth in adoption since we made it the default setting for most advertisers in Q4. This allows advertisers to enhance campaign performance by utilizing audience inputs as suggestions rather than strict parameters. Based on testing, campaigns using Advantage+ audience targeting have seen an average 28% reduction in cost per click compared to traditional targeting methods. For comprehensive automation products such as Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, we have also witnessed robust growth. Mark noted that the combined revenue from those two has more than doubled since last year. We believe significant opportunities remain to broaden adoption, as we aim to facilitate more conversion types for Advantage+ shopping, recently adding ten more types beyond purchase events. We are consistently integrating more functionalities into the Advantage+ tools over time, especially where many of our generative AI ad creative features have been incorporated, providing advertisers opportunities to experiment.","sentiment":"0.1"}

I think it's quite different from traditional search advertisements, and we aren't pursuing search ads specifically. Ultimately, this will likely constitute a different business model altogether. I believe there will be opportunities for advertisements and paid content interwoven into Meta AI interactions over time, as well as options for users to pay for enhanced models or increased computational resources. However, this is all still in the early stages of development. The most significant opportunity lies in our work around business messaging. This expands beyond the already-established efforts aimed at enhancing engagement and ad quality in our applications. With respect to business messaging, whether for creators or the over 100 million businesses on our platform, our aim is to simplify setting up AI engagement with their communities. For businesses, this means enabling sales and customer support interactions, while for creators, it could provide a fun and engaging element, as many creators use our platform to grow their businesses, whether they’re selling concert tickets or other products. Many of these creators aren’t leveraging advertising to its full potential. Similarly, the business messaging environments still remain relatively undervalued in terms of monetizable potential. Moreover, costs related to engaging audiences in messaging are still relatively high, but AI should significantly reduce these costs for businesses and creators. I think this presents a near-term opportunity, although it won't arrive within the next quarter or two, but it's not five years out either. Additionally, as Meta AI expands, I believe there will be monetization opportunities inherent in that scaling process as well, which we will develop gradually over time. Currently, our primary focus should be ensuring that hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people consider Meta AI as an integral part of their daily activities. This is the next milestone on our journey.","sentiment":"0.6"}

The forthcoming phase for several features is to tackle more complex tasks and develop more like agents rather than simple chatbots. By 'chatbot,' I mean a system that merely responds to your inquiries; it establishes a near 1:1 exchange. In contrast, an 'agent' will respond to your intent or goal and then proceed to execute multiple queries in the background to help meet that objective, whether it involves researching something online or selecting the right item to purchase. The potential complexity behind what users may be able to request from AI is significant. I believe that larger models—and future variations that may be smaller—can enable more fascinating interactions. For instance, the business use cases we discussed necessitate more than merely a sales or customer support chatbot fostering 1:1 interactions. When considering a business, there are broader objectives, such as delivering quality customer support and effectively marketing products tailored to consumer interests. The upcoming multiturn interactions will become vastly richer and more intricate, thanks to new reasoning and planning capabilities of emerging models. The opportunities here are substantial. Additionally, I believe we have effectively demonstrated our capacity to build leading models, so it is sensible to fully pursue this ambition, and we will. I envision this as a valuable long-term investment. I wanted to emphasize our focus and commitment to investing in this for the long term, as that aligns with our strategic approach.","sentiment":"0.4"}

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

{"_id":{"$oid":"680885047329ce07337b237d"},"quarter":"2024Q1","symbol":"AMZN","call_date":"2025-04-21T13:53:29.692497","timestamp":"2025-04-21","speaker":"Andrew Jassy","title":"CEO","content":"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making. Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the U.S., we recently welcomed Clinique and 2 Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our generative AI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment. As our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the U.S. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Faster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes. As we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact. Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our U.S. inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans. Advertising performance remained strong, with ad sales up 24% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offer brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It’s very early for streaming TV ads, but we're encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start. And given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere. We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure. And with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the deepest partner ecosystem, and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging generative AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already. You heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all 3 layers of the generative AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, Trainium and Inferentia, is quite high given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives. Larger quantities of our latest generation Trainium2 are coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker. Our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity.ai trains models 40% faster than SageMaker. Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under 7 months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker. The middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production generative AI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand the model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models. Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair, and Toyota. In the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models on the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's various models, Cohere's new models, and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a significant launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met. As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade generative AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications. Customers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these 2 linchpin services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing. The top of the stack are the generative AI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code. It also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones. In the near future, Q will help developers transform their .NET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. Q also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an 'add to favorites' feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3, and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories, and it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialogue with customers about this data. We also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe in natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data, and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data, but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors in catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, British Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slam, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today. I'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these generative AI services. It's less glamorous but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS. We expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for generative AI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power, and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way. We remain very bullish on AWS. We're at a $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. This is before you even calculate generative AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments. Our emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping, and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well. We just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value, and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year, in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shops. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content, with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Road House movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content. Our health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year, with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial beta. There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.","sentiment":"0.8"}

Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate. Second, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided. Excluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by strong operational performance across all 3 reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers: selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we helped customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability. Looking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improve profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place, and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads. Moving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts. AWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage. As we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals and making bigger commitments. It's still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see a sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter. Our Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the U.S. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. With that, let's move on to your questions.","sentiment":"0.7"}

Currently, we are managing both aspects simultaneously, which allows us to discuss our specific investments and their effects on our short-term outlook. Over the past 18 months, our improvements in operating income and free cash flow have largely come from enhancements in our stores business and reduced costs. Our regionalization efforts are advancing into inbound areas, and both advertising and AWS are performing well, with AWS margins increasing significantly. This improvement is largely due to effective cost controls, higher revenues, and a more efficient cost structure across the company.  Regarding capital expenditures, we will be significantly increasing our spending, primarily to support AWS infrastructure and generative AI initiatives, which will lead to higher depreciation in that segment. In the first quarter, we recorded $14 billion in CapEx, which we believe will be the lowest for the year. We are seeing strong demand from customers for longer deals and larger commitments, especially those involving generative AI, which gives us confidence in increasing our capital investments in this area.  As mentioned, our investment strategy has been consistent for 18 years—investing capital upfront to carefully build capacity for our customers, which results in revenue and operating income benefits over the long term with strong returns on invested capital. So, to summarize, the primary factor we anticipate in the near term is an increase in CapEx. Additionally, we continue to perform well in CapEx related to our stores business, which will primarily involve modest capacity increases and improvements to our same-day fulfillment network and logistics fleet. Ultimately, the major developments will be in the AWS segment.","sentiment":"0.4"}

I understand your question, Doug. The short answer is that we are positioned to succeed in both areas. There are significant opportunities in our existing large businesses, including stores, advertising, and AWS, and we foresee substantial growth ahead. We are making meaningful investments. Additionally, we are consistent in our belief that there's still room for improvement in our store cost structure. There are impressive growth opportunities in front of us. It’s important to remember that AWS is currently a $100 billion revenue run rate business, yet over 85 percent of global IT spending remains on-premises. If we expect that situation to change, as we do, it indicates we have considerable growth ahead, especially with the potential of generative AI. This technology presents opportunities not seen in a long time, possibly rivaling the impact of the cloud or even the Internet. Unlike the migration to the cloud, which requires significant effort, the generative AI workloads will largely be developed from scratch in the cloud, offering tremendous opportunities along with other early-stage investments. So we see this as a dual opportunity for us.","sentiment":"0.8"}

I think first of all, I think the lion's share of cost optimization is behind us. So I think companies will be smart and have learned a lot over the last number of months in how they run their infrastructure in the cloud. But I think the lion's share of the cost optimization is behind us. And I think people have moved to newer initiatives that I would, at a macro level, describe as modernizing their infrastructure and then trying to drive value at a generative AI. On the former, I think we were on this march before the pandemic, where most companies were trying to figure out how to move from on-premises to the cloud because it's more cost-effective, and it's faster to innovate, and they get real developer productivity. And then when the pandemic hit and people were in survival mode and the uncertain economy, you let people save costs wherever they could, and they got distracted on that. But they're back to pursuing and figuring it out because it's low-hanging fruit for them, and we see very significant growth in that space. And at the same time, we're seeing very significant momentum in people trying to figure out how to run their generative AI on top of AWS. I mentioned we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate that we see in AI already, and it's still relatively early days. And I think that there's at a high level, there's a few things that we're seeing that's driving that growth. I think first of all, there are so many companies that are still building their models. And these range from the largest foundational model builders like Anthropic, you mentioned, to every 12 to 18 months building new models. And those models consume an incredible amount of data with a lot of tokens, and they're significant to actually go train. And a lot of those are being built on top of AWS, and I expect an increasing amount of those to be built on AWS over time because of our operational performance and security as well as our chips, both what we offer from NVIDIA. But if you take Anthropic, as an example, they're training their future models on our custom silicon on Trainium. And so I think we'll have a real opportunity for a lot of those models to run on top of AWS. I think the thing that people sometimes don't realize is that while we're in the stage that so many companies are spending money training models, once you get those models into production, which not that many companies have, but when you think about how many generative AI applications will be out there over time, most will end up being in production when you see the significant run rates. You spend much more in inference than you do in training because you train only periodically, but you're spinning out predictions and inferences all the time. And so we also see quite a few companies that are building their generative AI applications to do inference on top of AWS. And a lot of it has to do with the services. And the primary example we see there is how many companies, tens of thousands of companies, already are building on top of Amazon Bedrock, which has the largest selection of large language models around and a set of features that make it so much easier to build a high-quality, cost-effective low latency, production-grade generative AI applications. So we see both training and inference being really big drivers on top of AWS. And then you layer on top of that the fact that so many companies, their models and these generative AI applications are going to have their most sensitive assets and data. And it's going to matter a lot to them what kind of security they get around those applications. And yes, if you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or 2, not all the providers have the same track record. And we have a meaningful edge on the AWS side so that as companies are now getting into the phase of seriously experimenting and then actually deploying these applications to production, people want to run their generative AI on top of AWS.","sentiment":"0.8"}

I will address your second question first. Regarding dividends, buybacks, or any capital structure changes, we don’t have anything to announce today. I’d like to reiterate our overall philosophy. Our primary focus is on investing to support growth opportunities and long-term investments in our businesses. We still see numerous opportunities to deploy capital that will yield significant returns, particularly in generative AI, which we feel strongly about. We are entering a different phase of free cash flow. As you pointed out, we experienced negative free cash flow in 2021 and 2022, following the pandemic, due to the expansion of our operations network and various expenses. That trend shifted in 2023 when we achieved our highest level of free cash flow to date, and this positive trend has continued into the first quarter. We are confident about our free cash flow outlook and expect higher capital expenditures this year. Additionally, we are using some of our cash flow to repay the debt we incurred during the period of negative free cash flow. We reached a peak in debt at the end of the first quarter last year and plan to pay down over $25 billion throughout this year. This is our top priority along with our capital expenditures for 2024. Beyond that, I have no further updates to share. Now, I’ll pass it to Andy to discuss store profitability, as I know there are common questions regarding how high operating margins can go compared to historical trends. We’ve looked back to the period before the pandemic, and we believe we can achieve those operating margins without the influence of advertising. We have not reached that point yet, but we are not restricting ourselves to this. We are actively seeking ways to optimize our processes across logistics, aiming to lower costs, increase speed, and enhance selection. We are making progress on multiple fronts, with a strong focus on cost as we enhance customer experience.","sentiment":"0.5"}

It's quite interesting what we’re developing in third-party logistics. In some ways, it reflects our experiences with other businesses, such as AWS, even though they differ significantly. We recognized our internal need to create various capabilities and suspected others had similar needs, leading us to build out those services. As our business grew, we found it challenging to import goods from abroad, deal with customs, and transport them to different facilities. Storing items in fulfillment centers is not ideal due to limited space, so it’s better to keep them in more affordable upstream storage facilities. Additionally, we wanted an automatic system to know when to replenish our constrained supply in fulfillment centers from upstream storage. We initially created these capabilities to serve our own operations and then offered these services to our sellers. We assist sellers with customs clearance and shipping items to various facilities, whether they are ours or theirs. Sellers can store products in our low-cost upstream warehouses and can automatically replenish our fulfillment centers or transfer items to their own facilities. We manage shipping to either our customers or theirs through our Buy with Prime feature, which boosts conversions for our Prime customer's sellers significantly. The supply chain with Amazon offers a simplified interface on top of these foundational services, allowing customers to have a fully integrated end-to-end supply chain. This entire set of services is growing rapidly and has already become a substantial business, although we see it as just the beginning. We do not expect this to create a large driver of capital expenses for us, as we need to develop many of these capabilities to support our stores business anyway. We believe accommodating third-party sellers will only lead to a modest increase in costs. Our third-party sellers find great value in us managing these logistics for them, ultimately saving them money.","sentiment":"0.6"}

We recently launched this initiative a few months ago, and it's showing promising results. Advertisers are enthusiastic about the chance to broaden their advertising reach with us, extending beyond Twitch and Freevee to include Prime Video shows and movies. They appreciate the unique relevancy and measurability of advertising on Prime Video, which is encouraging. While it's still early, we're optimistic about its potential.  Regarding grocery, we remain optimistic about our efforts in this area. Our grocery business is sizable and consists of various components, including a substantial non-perishables segment, akin to how mass merchandisers entered this market decades ago. This encompasses consumables, canned goods, pet food, healthcare, and beauty products, all of which are growing rapidly. Additionally, our organic grocery line at Whole Foods Market, a leader in this market, continues to thrive.  We're also introducing a smaller format this fall in Manhattan with the Whole Foods Market Daily Shops concept. Over the past 18 months, we’ve focused on enhancing profitability, and we're pleased with the progress. To effectively meet our grocery mission goals, having a perishables segment and a strong physical presence is essential. That's what we've been focusing on with Amazon Fresh.  We recently launched our V2 format in physical stores, mainly in Chicago and Southern California, and the early feedback has been very positive, showing significant improvements across various aspects. There are still some challenges to address, but we're encouraged by these results.  Furthermore, as you mentioned, we just introduced a Prime benefit for grocery, providing unlimited delivery for $9.99 a month. This benefit essentially pays for itself if you order once from Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh for smaller orders. It's a valuable offering for our Prime members and has started off strong. Overall, I believe we have numerous strategies to help customers fulfill their grocery needs, and I'm optimistic that this segment will continue to grow for us.","sentiment":"0.6"}

I'm going to start with this one on international profitability. So yes, in the quarter, our operating income was $902 million. And if you've watched that, we've seen a steady progression in operating income in our international segment, it's up $2.2 billion year-over-year. So we like the trend there. It breaks down into a few areas. I would say the established countries of Europe, Japan, as well as the U.K. are following a lot of the same trajectory as in the United States. They are profitable in their own right. They are adding selection, they're adding new features like grocery there, adding to their Prime benefits, and a lot of the work that we do in the United States carries over there. The second group is the emerging countries. And of course, we've launched 10 new countries in the last 7 years. Each of those has its own particular trajectory on profitability. The first thing we see there is having a good customer experience, having people sign up for Prime. A lot of times, our Prime Video benefits help with that. Then work on our cost structure as we get scale, add advertising, and other things. And eventually, what we see is a breakeven — countries breakeven and then they make positive income and free cash flow and are more of a contribution to the — positive contribution to the international segment. So we're seeing both the emerging and the established improving, and we like the trajectory. And I think you'll see more of that as we move forward.","sentiment":"0.5"}

I would add a few things. I mean, I'm again quite bullish on our international stores business. It's already a very large business. We've added a number of countries that are on the right trajectory, as Brian just indicated, and it's going to be a big, profitable business for us. And I really like the direction it's headed. I'll take also just the second part of your question just really around continuing to take — to work on cost structure. I'd say, first of all, on the regionalization side, which we've talked a lot about the last year, it may sound a little boring to talk about because we talked about it a lot of times. But I'd just tell you that we're not done there. A lot of the work that we've done, we still have opportunities to refine, to get more value out of that. And a lot of what we learned on the regionalization side in the U.S. was in part inspired from what we saw in Europe, which, in many ways, is set up as a regional network because of the nature of how close those countries are to one another. And I would say we have also learned lessons from what we've done in the U.S. that we're going to be able to apply to our international operations as well. I think we see additional opportunities in all sorts of places. A good example of which is just how and where we inbound items to. The architecture we've had set up has largely had people inbounding to a couple of places. And then we took — we spent a lot of effort and time and expense in breaking those down and shipping them to lots of other places. And we believe we're going to be much more efficient in how we use the inbound network and how we partner with our sellers. Part of what we did with our change in seller fees, we lowered the outbound fees in a meaningful way, but then we added an incentive for our sellers to inbound into locations that allow us to be more cost-efficient and allow both our sellers and us to enjoy in those cost savings when we're able to do so. And we're seeing very optimistic signs there, too. I think we're still early with respect to how we can continue to optimize the number of units per box, which has all sorts of good benefits. And then I'd just also say that it's been really interesting to watch the same-day facilities evolution in our fulfillment network. And I think a lot of people have made the assumption over the last few years that faster speeds are going to mean higher cost, and that is not the case if you build the infrastructure with the right building blocks the way we have over the last couple of years. And our same-day facilities are our least expensive facilities in the network. We still have a fraction of the number of those that we will have in the U.S. that we'll have in other parts of the world, which will, again, both change our cost structure while increasing speed. So I don't think we're at the limits of what we can do. It's not going to all happen in 1 year. We're going to be working hard at this and inventing at this for several years, but I think we have a lot of upside in front of us.","sentiment":"0.7"}
